HowToPlayText1	Among Us is a game of teamwork and betrayal.\n\nPlayers are either Crewmates or an Impostor.
HowToPlayText2	Play with 4 to 10 players online or via local WiFi!
HowToPlayText41	When hosting a game. you have control over how the game plays.
HowToPlayText42	Firstly, determine who you want to play with!\n\nIf you want to play with friends online, set to "private" and share the room code.\n\nIf you want to play with others from all around the world, set to "public".
HowToPlayText43	Want to play with more tasks? How about faster walk speed? More Impostors? As host, you can change these settings. Be sure to confirm the changes with your fellow players.
HowToPlayText44	If someone is being rude and/or spamming, hosts can temporarily kick players as a warning or ban players from the specific online room.
HowToPlayTextMap	Players have access to a personal map to help them navigate the ship.
HowToPlayTextCrew1	Objective: Fill Group Task Bar or Discover the Impostor.
HowToPlayTextCrew2	Complete tasks to fill gauge.
HowToPlayTextCrew3	React to Impostor's Sabotage.
HowToPlayTextCrew4	Call emergency meeting when Impostor found.
HowToPlayTextCrew5	Report dead bodies.
HowToPlayTextCrew6	Check Admin Map and Security for suspicious activity.
HowToPlayTextImp1	Objective: Kill off the Crew.
HowToPlayTextImp2	Blend in with the Crew.
HowToPlayTextImp3	Sneak through vents.
HowToPlayTextImp4	Pretend to run tasks.
HowToPlayTextImp5	Sabotage the ship and confuse the Crew.
HowToPlayTextImp6	Close doors and trap victims.
HowToPlayTextImp7	Kill off the Crew between cooldowns.
HowToPlayText5	While playing in person, no talking is allowed to keep the game fair between The Crew and The Impostor.\n\nIf a player is killed by The Impostor, they cannot talk until the game ends.\n\nGhosts still run their assigned tasks working towards a possible Crewmates win.
HowToPlayText6	When someone reports a dead body or calls an emergency meeting, the Crew gathers to discuss what they know about the Impostor.\n\nPlayers can now talk openly about who they think the Imposter is and what information they have. When playing in person, Ghosts cannot talk as they already know who the Impostor is.\n\nImpostors will try to prove their innocence or accuse another crew member.
HowToPlayText7	After discussion, vote for who you think is the Impostor.\n\nWhoever gets majority votes will be ejected from the ship, so vote wisely!\n\nIf you don't have enough information and have decided as a Crew, you can also skip voting to avoid ejecting someone innocent and gather more information.
HowToPlayText81	Practice in Freeplay mode!
HowToPlayText82	Set your own tasks as a Crew member or practice your Impostor killing strategies!
